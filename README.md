## Overview

![screenshot](./design/screencapture.png)

This project is a device shop checkout page created as a submission to a DevChallenges challenge. The goal was to build a responsive checkout page using HTML and CSS. The page includes features such as displaying product details, the total price, and a form for entering contact information.

### What I learned

- **Responsive Design**: I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a flexible layout that works well on both large and small screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## Features

- **Product Display**: The page displays a list of products with their images, names, prices, and quantities.
- **Coupon Code**: Users can enter a coupon code to apply discounts.
- **Contact Form**: A form for entering contact information, including name, email, country, and postal code.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
